# Pkg_router## DescriptionStock Joomla! routing is primitive at best. Moyo basically took the [Symfony 2 router](https://github.com/symfony/Routing) and ported it to Joomla using theNooku / Koowa framework.Pkg_router was created by [Moyo Web Architects](http://moyoweb.nl) and is currently used in several major projects.## Requirements* Joomla 3.X . Untested in Joomla 2.5.* Koowa 0.9 or 1.0 (as yet, Koowa 2 is not supported)* PHP 5.3.10 or better## InstallationInstallation is done through composer. In your `composer.json` file, you should add the following lines to the repositoriessection:```json{    "name": "moyo/router",    "type": "vcs",    "url": "https://github.com/cta-int/router.git"}```The require section should contain the following lines:```json    "moyo/router": "2.0.*",    "symfony/routing": "*",    "symfony/yaml": "*",    "symfony/config": "*",    "symfony/expression-language": "*"```Afterward, just run `composer update` from the root of your Joomla project.### jsymlinkerAnother option, currently only available for Moyo developers, is by using the jsymlink script from the [Moyo GitTools](https://github.com/derjoachim/moyo-git-tools).### UsageIn the administrator backend, in the menu item `Components >> Routes`, you can manage your routes. The routes areconfigured and parsed as per the [Symfony 2 router](http://symfony.com/doc/current/book/routing.html). A `routing.yml` iscreated or updated on save.Routing is component / package based. That is, aside from what is being generated in `routing.yml` a package name androute name are to be saved into the database.## ExampleGenerally, we do not use the stock categories, but our own Makundi package. The standard URL is something like`index.php?option=com_makundi&view=category&id=foo`. The routes table is parsed and the following rule is found: `/category/{slug}.{format}`.Given that the package name of this route is 'makundi', and the table name is 'category' the router knows that itshould should try to parse this rule.The router will automatically retrieve the `slug` field from  `#__makundi_categories` and generate path by these settings.This will yield the end result `http://example.com/category/slug` in which slug is of course the slug of the category.
